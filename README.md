SpaceGame
=========
Influenced by games like TradeWars, Eve Online, and FTL, I am creating the boringly, eventually will be renamed "SpaceGame".  This is the first game I've developed, so it's more of a fun experience than a profitable venture (my code is on GitHub...).

I've compiled an executable jar in this project for Windows play.  To play first install the latest version of Java (https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1).  Then download the SpaceGame.jar file along with the resources folder from this project.  Put the .jar and resources inside the same folder and run the jar.  It should run, huzzah?

There's an in game help menu that should, in theory, provide you with enough information to play.  But there's very little content considering I just started this project.  So there will be frequent updates and much more content to add.

If you find any bugs/issues/ideas/etc, please create an Issue so I can track everything here on GitHub.

And... back to coding...
